# 0. Introduction
# If your task requires high computational power, clusters can be very useful.
# Yet, you need to speak the cluster language to use it most efficiently.


# 1. Login
#= login to ecco using your favorite ssh client
   (e.g., Mac-Terminal, Windows-PuTTy, Chrome-Secure Shell app) =#
   ssh <yourid>@ecco.vrdc.cornell.edu

# 2. Using programs
   module list
   stata
   module avail
   module load stata
   stata
   exit

# 3. Using job scheduler
#= If you sit in front of a machine watching it compute your code,
   you might as well do it on your local computer...
   The whole point of ecco is to submit computing jobs remotely
   such that you can have your life! =#

# 3.1. Interactive qsub
#= If you are new to a cluster, you might want to launch interactive jobs
   in order to see how things work =#
   iqsub
   qstat
   qdel <yourjobid>

# 3.2. Advanced qsub
#= For more advanced jobs, you want to write your own qsub.

      Qsub documentation: http://docs.adaptivecomputing.com/torque/4-1-4/Content/topics/commands/qsub.htm
=#
   qsub <yourqsubscript>.qsub

# 4. Submitting a julia job
# Julia is not available on the head node! It is on the compute nodes.
# 4.1. Where is Julia...
   qsub -I -q premium -l nodes=compute-0-2
   module avail
   module load julia
   julia

# 4.2. How to write a Julia qsub
# Please read ~/cluster_qsub/ecco_job_script.qsub
